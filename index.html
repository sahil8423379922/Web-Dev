        Computers have become an integral part of modern society, permeating
        nearly every aspect of our lives. From the moment we wake up to the time
        we go to bed, we interact with computers in various forms, often without
        even realizing it. These powerful machines have revolutionized the way
        we work, communicate, learn, and entertain ourselves.At its core, a
        computer is a complex electronic device capable of processing data
        according to a set of instructions. It consists of several key
        components, including a central processing unit (CPU), memory, storage,
        input devices such as keyboards and mice, and output devices like
        monitors and printers. These components work together seamlessly to
        perform a wide range of tasks with incredible speed and accuracy.

        Computer hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system
        that you can touch and manipulate. These components are essential for
        the computer to function and perform various tasks. Hardware encompasses
        a wide range of devices, including the central processing unit (CPU),
        memory modules, storage devices, input devices, output devices, and
        peripherals.

        Software refers to a set of instructions, programs, or data that enable
        a computer system to perform specific tasks or operations. Unlike
        hardware, which consists of physical components, software is intangible
        and consists of code written in programming languages that tell the
        computer what to do. Software can be broadly categorized into two main
        types: system software and application software.
