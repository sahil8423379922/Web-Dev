          As an AI, I don't have access to personal data about individuals
          unless it has been shared with me in the course of our conversation. I
          am designed to respect user privacy and confidentiality. Therefore, I
          don't have any information about you unless you provide it to me in
          our current conversation. How can I assist you today?
